  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Japanese curry is different from Indian or Thai curries.</p>
  <p>It is more of a brown stew and it can be mild or spicy, depending on your tastes. The curry roux, from no heat to very spicy, can be bought at any international grocery store.</p>
  <p>It can be served over white rice or with udon noodles. This recipe is very flexible; it can easily be made for more or less people. It can also be frozen (don't put the potatoes in).</p>
